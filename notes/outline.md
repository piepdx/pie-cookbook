## PIE Cookbook

2. About 
	3. Context
		4. Building an accelerator is not a means of creating a community from scratch. Building an accelerator is a means of capitalizing on the momentum of an existing community, enabling community leaders, supporters, and contributors to focus their efforts in conjunction with that momentum for the greatest benefit — and highest likelihood of success — for that community.
		5. While PIE will speak from its vantage point on its experience as coworking space, a community hub, and an early stage tech startup accelerator, the PIE Cookbook is not meant to be tech specific. Nor is it meant to be a guide that only applies to startups. 
		6. We believe that the accelerator model is a powerful and efficient educational construct to can be applied to a variety of markets, businesses, and communities. 
		7. We believe that no one has perfected it yet. So you should feel free to adapt and revise it as you see fit. 
		7. We believe that the accelerator market is currently like the search engine market pre-Google. There are lots of well meaning people sort of doing things right but no one has really hit upon a repeatable and successful formula for doing this.
			8. Remember pre-Google Web? Well if you don’t, suffice it to say that there were a few choices for searching the Web, back in the day. Like hundreds. And no single one had significant traction. Mostly because they were all variations on a theme. Some were directories. Some were aggregators. Some were really, really smart algorithms. Many of them were wildly successful at the time. But none of them had really nailed the way to find the most relevant information on the Web. That’s kind of where we are with accelerators, today. And I’m hopeful that getting more smart people thinking about the model will help us find a better way of doing this. For everyone. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p
		8. Using higher education as an analogy, accelerators have our Harvard and Stanford. We have our Oxford. But where our state schools? Our small private liberal arts colleges? Where are our vocational schools and community colleges? We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface for this educational model.
			9. As far as accelerators go, we have our Ivy Leagues and our Stanford, but we have barely begun to scratch the surface for this educational model. Where is the Georgia Tech of accelerators? Where is the RISD? Where is the Reed or Whitman? Better yet, where is the state school or community college or junior college? Where is the vocational school of accelerators? There’s still plenty of room to explore this educational model. We have a long way to go before we’ve even leveraged the existing model, let alone begun to inflate the bubble. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p
		6. This document is full of "spoiler alerts," things that PIE has learned over the course of time. In most every case, it may not be wise — or downright foolhardy — to start where PIE ended. You should start where PIE started. And try to end where you want to end. 
		7. There is inherent value in the journey, itself.
		8. Risks
			9. Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for complete failure.
			10. You can go too far.
				11. In structure
				12. In goals
				13. In trying to over architect the experience
				14. In over planning and under participating
			11. Once you start, you cannot stop. Ever.
	4. Format
		5. How to use this book
			6. By way of analogy, the PIE Cookbook should serve as a map for your road trip. 
				7. It's a visualization of where you're trying to go and a record of all of the places you'll stop along the way as you head toward your intended destination. 
				8. We're providing the details and roadside attractions so that you understand what the journey will take. 
				9. Sometimes, you may get off the beaten path and discover something incredibly interesting. 
				10. Sometimes, the map may be dated and the roads don't exists anymore. So you'll need to find your own way. 
				11. It's not designed to be an airplane ticket that allows you to skip all of the messy stuff. The messy stuff is actually what it takes to bake something tasty, sustainable, and effective. 
				12. Unfortunately, we’ve now mixed metaphors with cookbooks and roadmaps. Get used to it. We said it was a mess.
		7. Open Source
			7. We are releasing this information as an open source project for a reason. Because we want this to be a conversation. 
				8. This isn't a broadcast or soliloquy. It's a collaboration among communities. 
				9. That's why, it is equally important that your provide feedback. What was helpful? What worked? What didn't work? What was complete malarkey? Where was PIE’s experience a matter of timing and luck, rather than repeatable? How did you do things differently?

			9. Unnecessarily proprietary: https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.97oi6moii
				10. “So with the PIE Cookbook, getting the chance to actually help lead an open source project…? That’s been a long time coming for me. I’m looking forward to learning — and probably making some mistakes. But no matter what, I’m really interested in seeing where the community takes this project.”
		6. History
			7. In that same vein, we are providing the PIE history as an example or parable, not a step-by-step, cookie cutter process for you to follow to achieve the same ends. 
			8. It is important to note that, like many things in the world of startups, PIE worked at a moment in time, because of the people involved, and the way the world happened to be going in Portland, Oregon, with open source, technology, startups, blogging, and creative agencies. 
			9. To put it another way, the way PIE came into being and worked would likely not work if we tried to do the same thing today. Too many things have changed. There is no way to recreate those random collisions of things. Or to recreate that period in time. 
			9. That said, your community is likely at a different place. Maybe there are similarities to our experience or moment in time. Maybe there are companies or individuals we’ll reference in the PIE Cookbook who remind you of someone in your community. 
			10. Whatever the case, we are hopeful that our history with PIE provides reference points that allow you to better identify — and take advantage of — potential opportunities in your community, today.
		7. Recipes
			8. Julia Child vs Better Homes and Gardens
				9. We don't expect you to follow these recipes step by step. This isn't a science experiment. This is sustenance for your community. And as such, it needs to taste the way your community wants it to taste. 
				10. We expect you to make these recipes your own. Maybe you like more salt or more spice. Do what works for your community. 
				10. Jump around as needed. Choose your own adventure.
					11. This isn’t a book you read cover to cover. 
					12. Some of this will seem obvious to you… but it’s not obvious to everyone
					13. Sometimes you’ll need to start later in the book and work your way backwards.
					14. Start with what you have. Go from there.
		10. Definitions
			11. We feel that it is extremely important to have a consistent set of language to describe the concepts and participants in this process. Without clear definitions, we run the risk of miscommunication — even when we think that we’re speaking the same language.

				10. "Founders are just another flavor of creative"
					11. Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don’t always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as “creative.” But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it’s important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who’ve chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.

					14. A means of empowering entities to initiate conversations that would be difficult, at best, if not downright impossible. 
					15. We have served this role throughout our history, enabling a variety of companies to engage in more meaningful and impactful conversations with critical partners.
		7. Experiments
			8. PIE's culture of experimentation
			9. PIE's culture of community
				10. (via @nohorse) "One of the things I always appreciated about PIE was that it felt like it embodies the spirit of collaboration in Portland. For example PIE seems at home in Centrl Office. It's likely something that is obvious to folks who have spent a while in Portland or Austin, but it's slow to sink in to some cities. There is a value in supporting other business incubators, maker spaces, coworking spaces, in your city and build a web of trust where everyone can feel safe and supported. Competition in the classic capitalistic sense is toxic to the young businesses that need as much help and support as they can to get off the ground and should never need to feel like they are picking brands or picking sides and potentially burning bridges to get the help they need. It might seem obvious to the cookbook authors, but it's worth explaining as it's a new concept to many folks."
			8. Coworking
				9. 2009-2011
				10. In 2009, PIE served as a curated coworking space for promising early stage startups and interesting creatives who called Portland home. During the coworking phase, PIE served as a hub for community, regularly hosting gatherings, hackathons, and educational meet ups.

		17. Patron(s)
			18. At PIE, we get a lot of questions about how to fund accelerator operations and investments. It makes sense. Finding the money that matches up with the opportunity is a challenge. It’s never easy. No matter how compelling the pitch. 
			18. What are the objectives?
			19. What is the expertise?
			20. How can they help?
			21. Can take several flavors (Note: This isn’t an exhaustive list. But it’s gives you a pretty good idea of where to look.)
				22. In our observations, there are four types of folks who fund accelerators. Sometimes they’re actual, well, folks. Sometimes they’re companies. Sometimes they’re angels or venture capitalists. But here are the buckets into which they seem to fall.
				22. True patron
				23. Sponsor
				24. Partner
				25. Investor
					26. On the upside, venture capital can be a very effective means of funding this sort of activity. 
						27. Used to spending money on risky efforts
						28. Have a time horizon that is in line with company maturation
						29. Have the potential to provide follow on investment.
						30. Ongoing portfolio management can be super valuable for the continued success of your companies.
					27. On the downside, this funding mechanism can curtail the experimental nature of an accelerator if VC is the only backing. 
						28. VCs are in the business of making money. 
						29. The relationship will be driven by financial motivations. 
						30. Will likely be only interested in investing in
							31. Companies that have the highest likelihood of returning capital to the fund 
							32. Companies that best match their investment thesis.
						33. This sort of focus can hamstring accelerators and incubators who may see promise or opportunity in verticals or companies that are outside of the fund’s purview. 
						34. Long story short, you don’t get to “experiment” with VC money. You get to make money.

			66. Don’t start with an accelerator
			66. Coworking and Community Development are not complementary
				67. We’ve tried any number of models: paid desks, free desks, desks in trade. What has worked best for us, to date, has been the concept of free desks for “mentors in residence.” This is usually reserved for people who have been through the program, but it’s also been used for companies like Sprintly, Automattic (WordPress), and Upworthy. We established a soft baseline for participation (“You have to be actively engaged in mentoring startups in the space.”) And assessed and judged that participation anecdotally. Those not meeting our expectation were counseled to up their mentoring game or encouraged to leave the space. We gave them a few warnings.
				68. Why do we believe this is an effective model for PIE and other accelerators? At the core, accelerators are about knowledge transfer. Retaining class participants beyond their cohort allows us to more efficiently transfer that knowledge (“You shouldn’t miss that mentor talk,” “You definitely need to connect with so and so,” and “I couldn’t help hearing you were having an issue with x. Here’s how we dealt with that.”)
				69. It seems counterintuitive but we’ve learned that giving startups desks for free often creates a tighter bond and stronger commitment than asking them to pay. That is, they perceive more value in the offering than office space to be more valuable than simply cash out of pocket. They feel like a valued part of the community. And since a very important part of our role is strengthening community, we feel this emotional tie has far more value that the rent check.
				70. Long story short, we feel we’ve gotten exponentially more value out of giving desks away than we ever would have by adding a few more dollars to the revenue stream.

				78. Have a thesis
					79. You don't have to be married to it forever and it can change as often as you want. But you need one. Your thesis can be defined by market dynamics, community trends, the expertise of your mentors, the success of your startups, the desires of your patron, or any combination thereof.
					80. At PIE, we hit upon the fact that we were really good at accelerating platforms and enabling technology. Why did we get good at this? There were any number of reasons.
						81. Portland has a culture of platforms and enabling technologies
						82. We inherited the culture of the agency itself moreso than the cultures of the agency's clients.
						83. Our mentors had expertise in building platforms.
						84. Our startups happened to be focused on platforms.
						85. The risk tolerance profile for the Portland community favored platforms and enabling technologies over consumer plays because the perceived risks and challenges are lesser.
						86. We started PIE just as both the SaaS and mobile markets were exploding
				87. Know where you suck
					88. Know — don’t assume; know — what you are truly good at doing.
					89. And even more importantly? Be willing to admit where you suck. 
					90. At PIE, it quickly became obvious that we sucked at helping startups with fundraising. We were hamstrung by several things. 
						91. First, there was a small investment community in Portland. 
						92. Second, the community that was there had little appetite for the types of companies—or the risk profiles of those companies—as investments. 
						93. Third, we had not established adequate ties with investors in other regions. We had friends here and there, but we didn’t have a strong rolodex of investors whose theses matched our startup profiles.
					94. But you know what? Admitting we sucked at that — and being open with our applicants that we sucked at that — freed us up to be better at any number of other things. And made us way better and more focused on the things we were good at doing. Not only that, but it provide us with yet another measure by which to select the companies we chose.

					105. More independent study than classroom
						106. Founders are extremely creative and driven, but they  are also intently focused on the immediate problem at hand. To them, nothing else matters but the problem they are working on right now today. Which, of course, tends to differ from startup to startup. And while those startups may _eventually_ all experience the same problem, they will not intuit that the problem exists until they encounter it. Therefore, it is our opinion that it is  nearly impossible to teach at scale in a classroom environment on an ongoing basis.
						107. However, do be on the lookout for opportunities where every startup is experiencing the same exact problem at the same exact time. Take advantage of those opportunities. But take advantage of them ad hoc, and on the fly.
						108. Some examples of these struggles that impact all founders simultaneously are learning how to meet, roughing out financial projections, pricing their product, and pitching.

							101. Presentation with Q&A
								102. As we mention above, founders only care about the problem they’re experiencing today, right now. To further the disconnect, even if a mentor provides step-by-step instructions with excruciating details, the founder will never be able to recreate the steps, moments in time, or luck that founder had. 
								103. For this reason, we suggest that mentor presentations primarily be used as an anecdotal learning experience. Not a teaching one.
								104. Your primary objective with this format is to convince your founders that they, like the mentor, are capable of succeeding. 
								104. Mentors, therefore, should avoid chest thumping. They should be comfortable sharing stories of failure, mistakes, and missteps. Things the mentors wish they had done differently. Stories about how they got lucky. And things they wish they had known during their journey. 
								105. This allows the founders to extract the content that is important and relevant to their current frame of mind and ask clarifying questions as needed.
