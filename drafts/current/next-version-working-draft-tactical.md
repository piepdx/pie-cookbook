# TOPICS FOR PIE COOKBOOK 2.0

We ran the first class for four and half months, and it seemed to be too long. So we shortened the program. Later, we'll get into why it seemed long. 


## Culture

			56. Hospitality
				57. "Have hospitality be a focus and core value of the accelerator.  be welcoming and let people know it…  at meetups do we welcome new people, in the accelerator do we communicate in a way that  is respectful and heard by all…  and are we authentic and appreciate authenticity in others" (via Shane Johnson)
				58. There is some hospitality content in this post https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/want-to-start-an-accelerator-don-t-start-an-accelerator-fa88e457be0b#.ahsv3suf1


## Format

We’ve structured this as a cookbook for an accelerator. And admittedly, we may have been a little heavy handed with that whole analogy. Sorry. That’s just how we roll. But you’ll get used to it. 

At least, we’re not subjecting you to the endless stream of idiotic pie related puns we bandy about on a daily basis. So be thankful for that. 

Besides, it seemed to be a really compelling way to get you from the first taste of an accelerator to, well, dessert. 

And honestly, when it comes right down to it? You’ll quickly realize that every founder has the exact same personality traits as a temperamental chef. Obsessed with perfection. Driven to succeed. Shouldering the brunt of every criticism no matter how seemingly minute.

And loving what they do. Not matter how hard and painful it is to foster the creation of something amazing.  

One of the most important headings you’ll find throughout the cookbook will be labeled “Mistakes were made.” This is where PIE screwed up, tripped, or outright failed. Why is this critical? Because you can follow the recipe word for word and never accurately recreate PIE. But you can always learn from our mistakes.

You’ll also see sections labeled “Happy accidents.” These are times where we tried something random or accidentally discovered a benefit through absolutely no planning whatsoever. It just sort of happened. Salt fell in the pot and it just tasted better. And it helped. And hopefully it will help you. And inspire you to take random risks of your own.

Finally, we’ll do our best to share all of the ingredients, preparations, step-by-step instructions, and intended results of these recipes. And if we don’t do that terribly well? Tell us. And we’ll fix it. For everyone. 

Note: Your flavors of PIE will vary. In fact, they must vary. If they don’t, you’re likely doing it wrong.

**Building a studio**

When it comes right down to it, all we’ve done at PIE is figure out a way to create a protected and trusted environment for creative people to try new things — and potentially fail. It’s like any artist’s studio. 

				78. Setting expectations
				79. Communicating expectations
			78. Time period
			79. Number of classes per year
			80. Number of companies per class
			81. Continued coworking or not?


**Virtual programs**
We learned a lot throughout the pandemic on the dynamics of a virual program.

## Community
[PLACEHOLDER] Provide analogies/examples of each of the communities above.

## Recipes

We don't expect you to follow these recipes step by step. This isn't a science experiment. This is sustenance for your community. And as such, it needs to taste the way your community wants it to taste. 

We expect you to make these recipes your own. Maybe you like more salt or more spice. Do what works for your community. 

## Prerequisite reading
### Required
	
#### [Startup Communities](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1480563854) 
	
If you haven't read [**Startup Communities**](http://www.startuprev.com/category/communities/) by [Brad Feld](http://feld.com/), please stop right here. If there is any prerequisite for the **PIE Cookbook**, it is **Startup Communities**. 

So much of what informed the Portland startup community is documented there. Many of the things we did accidentally in Portland, Oregon — or things which happened by luck — are clearly articulated in the book. And so is much of what has enabled Boulder, Colorado, to become one of the most entrepreneurially dense places on earth.

So go read it. And highlight it. And quote it.  

Don't rush it. Take the time to consume the book and think about it. Maybe a couple of times. We'll wait.

If you're working to develop and support a nascent community, Brad's book provides a critical roadmap for that development — as well as delineating a timeline for how long you should expect that development to take.

## History of PIE


		7. A Tale of Two Cities
			7. Portland startup community
			8. Wieden+Kennedy
		7. Founding hypotheses
			8. Startup community
				9. Provide a means and method of “giving back” to channel the pent up desire of the community to do so
				9. "Build better founders"
				10. "Make new mistakes"
			9. Wieden+Kennedy (aka, W+K, Wieden)
				10. "Founders are just another flavor of creative"
					11. Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don’t always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as “creative.” But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it’s important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who’ve chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.
				12. Fail harderer. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1760/1*p-8RVqSOywefET-W2TnBgw.jpeg
				13. PIE has always been a wedge
					14. A means of empowering entities to initiate conversations that would be difficult, at best, if not downright impossible. 
					15. We have served this role throughout our history, enabling a variety of companies to engage in more meaningful and impactful conversations with critical partners.
		7. Experiments
			8. PIE's culture of experimentation
			9. PIE's culture of community
				10. (via @nohorse) "One of the things I always appreciated about PIE was that it felt like it embodies the spirit of collaboration in Portland. For example PIE seems at home in Centrl Office. It's likely something that is obvious to folks who have spent a while in Portland or Austin, but it's slow to sink in to some cities. There is a value in supporting other business incubators, maker spaces, coworking spaces, in your city and build a web of trust where everyone can feel safe and supported. Competition in the classic capitalistic sense is toxic to the young businesses that need as much help and support as they can to get off the ground and should never need to feel like they are picking brands or picking sides and potentially burning bridges to get the help they need. It might seem obvious to the cookbook authors, but it's worth explaining as it's a new concept to many folks."
			8. Coworking
				9. 2009-2011
				10. In 2009, PIE served as a curated coworking space for promising early stage startups and interesting creatives who called Portland home. During the coworking phase, PIE served as a hub for community, regularly hosting gatherings, hackathons, and educational meet ups.

## Activity examples 

### Cooking class
With a name like PIE, it should come as little surprise that a number of our activities revolve around food. And when you have that much creative talent in one room, sometimes it's refreshing to give folks a different outlet for that creativity — especially one that doesn't involve banging on a keyboard. 

One activity that met both our food and creativity needs was a cooking class. For the first couple of years, we partnered with a local food accelerator that had commercial kitchen space. They put together a menu, taught our founders to prepare a dish from scratch, and then the entire group had the opportunity to share in the creations, family style. 

Everyone — no matter how well attuned they were to a kitchen — was out of his or her element. And it put everyone on equal footing. Best of all, there were always a few unexpected surprises when we discovered the true chefs in our midst.

Each year we did this resulted in the best family dinner of the class. 

### Alumni vs new class kickball or picnic 
### Away from the computer/office activities 
### Mixers + happy hours
we’ve done hot sauce tasting, cheese and wine pairings, etc

### Family open house
a lot of program companies have families.  It’s nice to give family and friends an opportunity to check out the space

Admittedly we could do a better job of fostering the community among all of our classes, but at the very least there is an understanding that they can count on one another for support.

	## So which is speed dating or matchmaking? Both.

Unfortunately, there is no easy answer. It's a balance of both types of mentoring.

Why? Well, in our experience, we've learned that each model has its pros and cons. That is why we have always opted to run a hybrid model. Most accelerators try to do the same.  

				99. Mentor engagement
					100. Formal
						101. Presentation with Q&A
							102. As we mention above, founders only care about the problem they’re experiencing today, right now. To further the disconnect, even if a mentor provides step-by-step instructions with excruciating details, the founder will never be able to recreate the steps, moments in time, or luck that founder had. 
							103. For this reason, we suggest that mentor presentations primarily be used as an anecdotal learning experience. Not a teaching one.
							104. Your primary objective with this format is to convince your founders that they, like the mentor, are capable of succeeding. 
							104. Mentors, therefore, should avoid chest thumping. They should be comfortable sharing stories of failure, mistakes, and missteps. Things the mentors wish they had done differently. Stories about how they got lucky. And things they wish they had known during their journey. 
							105. This allows the founders to extract the content that is important and relevant to their current frame of mind and ask clarifying questions as needed.
