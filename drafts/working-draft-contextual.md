## Preface 
> It's hard for people to realize now how inconsequential YC seemed at the time. I can't blame people who didn't take us seriously, because we ourselves didn't take that first summer program seriously in the very beginning. But as the summer progressed we were increasingly impressed by how well the startups were doing.… When people came to YC to speak at the dinners that first summer, they came in the spirit of someone coming to address a Boy Scout troop. By the time they left the building they were all saying some variant of "Wow, these companies might actually succeed."

> - Paul Graham, [How Y Combinator Started](http://old.ycombinator.com/start.html)

This cookbook all began simply enough. As a way of formalizing the mechanics and processes of the PIE program. In case one of us, as the euphemism goes, got hit by a bus. Painfully.

But once we started working on it. And building it out. We realized that we were actually beginning to scratch the surface of something much larger. Something far more compelling. 

What we had hit upon — unbeknownst to us at the time — was a framework for anyone, anywhere to start building a startup accelerator. 

Or, perhaps even more generically, a way for people to accelerate creative output. 

As with framework, we were curious as to whether what we had built would have value for others. Was it repeatable? Where were our blind spots? Could others improve upon our initial learnings? Suffice it to say, we had tons of questions. 

So drawing on our Portland open source roots, we began to think of this as something bigger than PIE. And what better way to enable folks from all communities to join us in taking on that challenge than to open source the document? An open invitation for others to provide feedback and insights for the greater good. And a starting point — a baseline — from which we could continue to iterate, test, and revise much as we would with any startup. Or experiment. 

Because the best thing about experiments is that whether you succeed or fail you always, always, always learn something.

Welcome to the PIE Cookbook.

### Caveats

I have always been a fan of books that start with a caveat or two. Because inevitably, you, gentle reader, have just started down this path. And given that you've already started to get a feel for where this is going, you're inevitably jumping to the question: Is this book for me?

The answer is yes. But with a few caveats.

#### 1. This is not a problem technology can solve. 

If technology could solve this problem, we would have built it. Trust us. But it can't. This isn't about algorithms or dynamically connecting dots. This is about getting to know people. And what makes them tick. And what pisses them off. And what scares them. This is about seeing non-obvious connections. It is about using what artists refer to as "negative space." Finding opportunity in what is absent or invisible.   
  
> Negative space, in art, is the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. Negative space may be most evident when the space around a subject, not the subject itself, forms an interesting or artistically relevant shape, and such space occasionally is used to artistic effect as the "real" subject of an image.  
  
> The use of negative space is a key element of artistic composition. The Japanese word "ma" is sometimes used for this concept, for example in garden design.  
  
> - ["Negative space" in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space)  
  
So if you're looking for a way to throw technology at the problem and avoid the messy feels and stuff, it's probably best to stop reading here and starting searching the web for what you think you need.

![All the feels](/source/images/all-the-feels.jpg "All the feels")
 
#### 2. This is not a scalable solution. 

This is the very reason we're not seeking to stamp out a ton of cookie cutter versions of PIE. Because our way of doing this doesn't scale. Well, that and "cookie cutter" and "PIE" is a mixed metaphor. We don't believe you can recreate what we created to solve Portland, Oregon's technology startup problem late in the first decade of this century. Nor would we want you to.     
  
It's not that we haven't tried. We have. But each time, it comes out differently. Because the community the each accelerator model supports needs it to be different. 

Again, if your hope is to find some easily repeatable way of doing this, the way is shut. It was made by those who are communities. And the communities keep it. The way is shut. 

![The way is shut](/source/images/way-is-shut.gif "The way is shut")

#### 3. This is not an efficient solution. 

Given the first two caveats, it is appropriate to assume the third — and potentially most obvious — caveat, that one of how time consuming this is. It doesn't scale. There are no technology shortcuts. It takes time. But none of it is wasted. Even if you're making mistakes. Because it is through that process of trying, iterating, changing, and learning that you will manage to build the best accelerator for your community — no matter what that community happens to be.

#### 4. Be intentional

So much of what occurs in an accelerator environment appears to happen organically and dynamically. But appearances, as they say, can be deceiving. And can belie all of the prior effort that has been invested prior to the accelerator environment.

To be successful, you must be intentional. And work with the intent of making stuff happen. Not just letting stuff happen.

## Format

We’ve structured this as a cookbook for an accelerator. And admittedly, we may have been a little heavy handed with that whole analogy. Sorry. That’s just how we roll. But you’ll get used to it. 

At least, we’re not subjecting you to the endless stream of idiotic pie related puns we bandy about on a daily basis. So be thankful for that. 

Besides, it seemed to be a really compelling way to get you from the first taste of an accelerator to, well, dessert. 

And honestly, when it comes right down to it? You’ll quickly realize that every founder has the exact same personality traits as a temperamental chef. Obsessed with perfection. Driven to succeed. Shouldering the brunt of every criticism no matter how seemingly minute.

And loving what they do. Not matter how hard and painful it is to foster the creation of something amazing.  

One of the most important headings you’ll find throughout the cookbook will be labeled “Mistakes were made.” This is where PIE screwed up, tripped, or outright failed. Why is this critical? Because you can follow the recipe word for word and never accurately recreate PIE. But you can always learn from our mistakes.

You’ll also see sections labeled “Happy accidents.” These are times where we tried something random or accidentally discovered a benefit through absolutely no planning whatsoever. It just sort of happened. Salt fell in the pot and it just tasted better. And it helped. And hopefully it will help you. And inspire you to take random risks of your own.

Finally, we’ll do our best to share all of the ingredients, preparations, step-by-step instructions, and intended results of these recipes. And if we don’t do that terribly well? Tell us. And we’ll fix it. For everyone. 

Note: Your flavors of PIE will vary. In fact, they must vary. If they don’t, you’re likely doing it wrong.

**Building a studio**

When it comes right down to it, all we’ve done at PIE is figure out a way to create a protected and trusted environment for creative people to try new things — and potentially fail. It’s like any artist’s studio. 

## PIE as an example

> My hope is that you do not view the use of Boulder here as "Boulder tooting its own horn." I use Boulder as an example of a lasting and vibrant startup community because I know it extremely well (at least one segment). This approach is called synecdoche, where the part stands for the whole. There are many things the Boulder startup community can do better and many more for it to discovers we continue on our journey; my hope is that by exploring it in depth it helps you with your journey in your startup community.

> - Brad Feld in Startup Communities

Throughout this book, you’ll find us using PIE as an example. I mean, I guess it makes sense. It’s the accelerator we know best. But please keep in mind that references to PIE are meant to serve as that and only that. An example. 

It’s not doctrine. Or a specific recipe. Or maybe even the right way to do things. In fact, we’ll highlight—on any number of occasions—how it was absolutely not the right way to do things.

Please don’t think that we’re purporting to have the only recipe for an accelerator. Because we don’t. And if that’s what you’re hoping to get out of this book, then you should probably stop reading right now.

Because there are plenty of ways for you to start an accelerator based solely on someone else’s model. And there are any number of successful accelerators that have programs to help you do this. There are also any number of curricula available for purchase that will arm you to deliver their prescribed way of learning.

And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with taking those paths to an accelerator. For many, that is the only viable way of effectively achieving the goals they are trying to meet. 

But that’s not what this book is designed to do. Far from it.

What this book is designed to do is quite simple. We’re going to teach you to fish.

We simply wanted to provide some contextual evidence for our learnings at PIE, the majority of which will be purely anecdotal. This is a conceit to bring our theoretical guidance into more tactical applications. And to prove to you that we screwed up a lot, made a ton of mistakes, and got lucky in any number of ways. 

And it’s important to note that we have realized these concepts not only in the context of early stage technology startups. Yes, we’ve spent the majority of our time and learning applying these techniques to early stage tech startups. But we’ve also experimented with these techniques on nonprofits, open source projects, and solo founders. We’ve applied these techniques to more traditional creative pursuits. We’ve even had opportunities to test these processes on internal employee teams as a means of driving innovation throughout large corporations. 

Long story short, there are any number of ways to apply the concepts of trust, pressure, and mentorship to any number of creative pursuits. To accelerate creative output. 

But our context for this experimentation has always been PIE. And in order for PIE to make sense as a point of reference, you need to understand a little bit of the history of the organization. And also recognize that, much like you, we started by simply taking what others were doing, using that as a framework for something different, and iterating from there. 

While we’ll get into specific elements of the program, its composition, and its multiple iterations throughout the book, here is some grounding in where this whole thing started.

## [SIDEBAR] No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. 
[Source](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05 "Permalink to No interest in building a startup accelerator like PIE? Good. — Portland Incubator Experiment — Medium")

### Our motivation to[ share the _PIE Cookbook_][10] isn't to convince you to recreate[ PIE][11]. It's to inspire you to create something new — and better.

I was having a conversation with a friend, recently. Given that we're both startup types, the topic of conversation eventually gravitated to the [_PIE Cookbook_][10] project.

His response? An unadulterated "**Meh.**"

I paused.

I mean, he's a serial entrepreneur. He's been mentored. He's been a mentor. He's seen a bunch of startups. He's currently working for a startup — _that went through an accelerator_.

Why wasn't this concept super interesting to him?

The reason — it didn't take me long to realize — is because **the thought of starting some also-ran tech startup accelerator isn't terribly interesting to _most_ people these days**.

And then it dawned on me. The idea of convincing others to build some preconceived, generic tech accelerator hosting a hodgepodge of startups, in this day and age, **wasn't even a concept that motivated or interested me**.

Furthermore, it occurred to me as we continued the conversation that we, as PIE, had just assumed — or taken for granted — that our true motivations for creating the _PIE Cookbook_ were obvious. And that our hopes for this next phase of the ongoing experiment were clear.

**They're not.**

So let's be clear. **Inspiring the creation of a bunch of generic startup accelerators is not — at all — how we hope people will use the _PIE Cookbook_.** Trust us.

But at first blush, I realize that's _exactly_ what it looks like we were trying to do. And with this new vantage, I recognize how our prevailing assumptions, today's startup rat race, and our lack of clarity may lead to a very flawed first impression of the _PIE Cookbook_.

That's our fault. So I'd like to ask you to **please take a moment to look deeper.**

### PIE is actually an experiment in accelerating creativity

When[ Renny][12] reached out to me to start the conversation that would eventually become PIE, he had one very clear hypothesis he was interested in testing:

> Entrepreneurs and technologists are a new creative class, and their problem-solving toolkit will be increasingly important to solve the emerging brand challenges we tackle at Wieden+Kennedy. But words and images don't always seem to play well with code. And folks great at one craft may not recognize another as "creative." But in a world of distributed software and hardware, it's important to find ways to work together. Entrepreneurs and technologists are inspired creatives who've chosen technology as their medium for creative expression. We should be able to find ways to do cool stuff, together.

And that hypothesis has remained a guiding principle for PIE for nearly a decade. First as a coworking space then as a startup accelerator then as a means of effecting more compelling collaborations between corporations and startups. But through and through, we've always been about **creating innovation communities** and **accelerating creative output**.

The _PIE Cookbook_ is no different.

### It's your job to improve upon the recipe

With that in mind, **please don't try to recreate PIE**. In fact, we would hate for you to bake our flavor of PIE. This isn't a sleeve of prepared cookie dough that you halfheartedly slice onto a cookie sheet. This is a "Bake your own" proposition. This is a recipe. And everyone has their own unique ingredients.

This is about rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands in the mix. Making the recipe yours. Experimenting, manipulating, iterating, exploring, and improving.

**The world needs more variety — not less.** And together, we all get better.

Therefore, we'd like to ask: How might the PIE recipe be adapted to meet your community's needs?

Maybe you could…

* Use the PIE recipe to create an environment that focuses on companies engaged in services-based businesses — read "not candidates for equity investment." Maybe you could create ways to better meet their unique business needs? And maybe you could create entirely new ways of investing in and evaluating these companies? You could. Because that's exactly what[ **Oregon Story Board**][13] is doing with the PIE recipe, as it accelerates companies in the world of digital storytelling. All of which enabled them to be among Carnegie Mellon, Dartmouth, UC Berkeley, and Virginia Tech as an[ early stage grantee for Microsoft HoloLens][14].
* Leverage the PIE model to focus on issues that are adversely impacting your community. Like lack of inclusion. And ineffective support for women founders. Maybe you could use it to raise the visibility of a whole ton of awesome founders from communities of color? Maybe this effort could be part of a broader economic plan to make your entire community a better place to live? You could. Because that's how the [Portland Development Commission][15] is adapting the PIE recipe to guide and accelerate companies in the[ **Startup PDX Challenge**][16].
* Identify the compelling knowledge and resources your community has accumulated. And look for ways to activate that knowledge by using an a PIE-flavored accelerator to focus that energy. That expertise could be geographical. It could be cultural. It could be the business environment, itself. You could. Because that's exactly what the town of Newberg, Oregon — the gateway to the Willamette Valley wine country — is doing with the[ **Newberg Innovation Accelerator**][17], a project that will focus efforts on agricultural technology projects and businesses that directly impact the wine industry.
* Use the PIE recipe as means of changing the way employees approach, attack, and resolve problems _within_ a corporation. You could bring a cross-functional team of folks from throughout the company to a shared communal workspace that resembles an accelerator. To work for three months on an entrenched problem, free from the typical approval cycles and sacred cows of corporate life. To get them out of the building and get them engaged with real customers. To hear, firsthand, how they can fix things. You could. Because that's exactly what[ **Daimler**][18]** did with their SPIN program**, by using the PIE recipe to create an internal accelerator. For employees.
* Or maybe you could **come up with something completely unique**. Maybe you could use the PIE recipe to build new curricula at a college. Or to create a nonprofit accelerator. Or to change the dynamic of an R&amp;D shop. Or to rethink craft brewing. Or to create agencies. Or to help Kickstarter projects survive, post funding. Or to change the world of VR. Or to help bloggers build better business models. Or to give artists an environment to create. Or to help a diverse slice of indie game developers change the face of gaming. Or to build a maker space. Or to help lifestyle companies succeed more efficiently. Or or or or…

The point is that the _PIE Cookbook_ is designed **to inspire you to do something**. To help you frame up your organization, your community, and yourself. To give you a pattern for what success might look like. And how to budget for chaos, random constructive collisions, and innovation. **To get creative. Not repetitive.**

The _PIE Cookbook_ is designed to help provide a framework and some confidence. To give you courage. [To provide suggestions][19] and inspiration. It's designed to help you understand — or to educate your superiors — that it's actually okay to try this stuff. To show them it's not just _acceptable_ to participate, but it's exciting and critical to survival as well. **The _PIE Cookbook_ is our way of telling you to step off that cliff and go for it.**

Not interested in building a generic tech startup accelerator? Good. Please don't. [Go do something more interesting than that][10].

And, by all means, please keep us in the loop. We're looking forward to learning from — and with — you.

## Motivations

It seems a lot of folks want to build an accelerator to somehow create a startup community from scratch. Unfortunately, that's not really how this thing works. 

An accelerator can attract a community. An accelerator can codify a community. An accelerator can even import a community. But an accelerator has to have a community. 

Building an accelerator is not a means of creating a community from scratch. Building an accelerator is a means of accelerating or capitalizing on the momentum of an existing community, identifying and enabling community leaders, and providing infrastructure for supporters and contributors to engage, thereby enabling all parties, throughout the community, to focus everyone's efforts to the greatest benefit — and highest likelihood of success — for that community.

The best accelerators spring up from communities. Great communities can form around accelerators, but they need a seed community from which to spring.

If you don't have an existing community, keep this in mind when you're deciding on the focus of your accelerator. Because if you don't have a community then your accelerator needs to be attractive enough to recruit a community around it.

## Understanding — and working within — the existing culture of the community

Every accelerator needs a community. Every community does not need an accelerator.

Communities exist on a spectrum. Some communities don't even realize that they're communities. Others are a loosely assembled group of individuals who identify with peers and members of their community through a feeling of commonality and affinity, even though they lack definition, infrastructure, and process for formalizing that community. Still other communities are well defined, organized, and managed as communities.

[PLACEHOLDER] Provide analogies/examples of each of the communities above.

When it comes to accelerators, no one type of community has a particular advantage over any other. They all have their respective pros and cons.

Amorphous and nebulous communities, for example, have the benefit of needing the structure accelerators bring to a community. That's an upside. No pre-existing conditions or competition or toes on which to step. That's awesome. On the downside, these ill defined communities are — well — ill defined. As such, they don't have easily accessible resources into which an accelerator can immediately tap. The onus, therefore, is on the accelerator to create these assets and resources from scratch.

Conversely, a well established community — on the upside — could have a wealth of infrastructure and programmatic elements which can be leveraged by an accelerator. While on the downside, it may have pre-existing and well established players, organizations, and cultural mores that prevent an accelerator from being as effective as it can be — without spending significant political capital to navigate the existing infrastructure.

See? Pros and cons. No community is perfect.

What we're saying is that the community doesn't have to be a certain kind of community to support the concept of an accelerator. It simply has to exist. As a community. Even if the members of said community are still not fully cognizant of the community's existence or their inclusion therein.

If you, as the accelerator perceive something that behaves like community — no matter how ill defined — then there's enough there to begin.

### Accelerators function within communities

Accelerators can be a means of bringing an existing — but nebulous and ill defined — community together. Or accelerating the momentum of an organized community.

But make no mistakes. Accelerators are not a means of creating a community from scratch. And this is an assumption that most people make. Many potential accelerator founders are enamored of the concept of creating an accelerator that will somehow result in the creation of an amazing and vibrant community. It's actually the converse that is true.

Community first. Accelerator second.

To be successful, you must work within the context and culture of your existing community. You're not going to be successful trying to build something that flies in the face of the community in which you're trying to build it.

## Current state of accelerators 

While PIE will speak from its vantage point on its experience as coworking space, a community hub, and an early stage tech startup accelerator, the PIE Cookbook is not meant to be tech specific. Nor is it meant to be a guide that only applies to startups.
 
We believe that the accelerator model is a powerful and efficient educational construct to can be applied to a variety of markets, businesses, and communities. 

We believe that no one has perfected it yet. So you should feel free to adapt and revise it as you see fit. 

We believe that the accelerator market is currently like the search engine market pre-Google. There are lots of well meaning people sort of doing things right but no one has really hit upon a repeatable and successful formula for doing this.

Remember pre-Google Web? Well if you don’t, suffice it to say that there were a few choices for searching the Web, back in the day. Like hundreds. And no single one had significant traction. Mostly because they were all variations on a theme. Some were directories. Some were aggregators. Some were really, really smart algorithms. Many of them were wildly successful at the time. But none of them had really nailed the way to find the most relevant information on the Web. That’s kind of where we are with accelerators, today. And I’m hopeful that getting more smart people thinking about the model will help us find a better way of doing this. For everyone. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p

Using higher education as an analogy, accelerators have our Harvard and Stanford. We have our Oxford. But where our state schools? Our small private liberal arts colleges? Where are our vocational schools and community colleges? We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface for this educational model.

As far as accelerators go, we have our Ivy Leagues and our Stanford, but we have barely begun to scratch the surface for this educational model. Where is the Georgia Tech of accelerators? Where is the RISD? Where is the Reed or Whitman? Better yet, where is the state school or community college or junior college? Where is the vocational school of accelerators? There’s still plenty of room to explore this educational model. We have a long way to go before we’ve even leveraged the existing model, let alone begun to inflate the bubble. https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.qjyagrd3p

## Spoiler alert

This document is full of "spoiler alerts," things that PIE has learned over the course of time. In most every case, it may not be wise — or downright foolhardy — to start where PIE ended. You should start where PIE started. And try to end where you want to end. 

There is inherent value in the journey, itself.

Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for disaster. 

Accelerators don't start communities. Communities start accelerators.

Your accelerator should be a reflection of your community — or the community you want to attract. 

In other words, don't try to build an accelerator that doesn't have a target community. 

For PIE, that target community was the startup community that was beginning to form in Portland. It was the combination of the open source community, a nascent group of early stage companies who were seeking assistance and capital, and a group of experienced startup folks who were looking for a means of giving back to the community. Folks who were willing to share their expertise if only there were a means of doing that.

- It's a means of catalyzing existing community
- Be honest about your community
- You can only work with what you've got
- You have to start with the ingredients your community has, but you don't need to follow the existing community momentum
- You're allowed to bring different ingredients into the community, but the initial activity must start with existing assets
- Some of your community assets may have never combined before (e.g., Portland startup community and W+K), but they're still both assets to be considered

It is incredibly difficult to do virtual communities well. Not loosely affiliated social networks. Clearly folks have managed to do that. But communities. Actual interacting and collaborating communities. Groups of people who share common interests, work toward common goals, and support one another. 

In our experience, this kind of activity does not happen out in the ether. It happens somewhere. Physically and personally. Community, we believe, needs a place. 

And this has come into sharp relief as we've moved away from PIE being a physical presence. We've learned that not having a physical space has actually weakened our ability to scale and the strength of our connections. The more we rely on virtual, the more it makes it difficult to accomplish the things our community needs. 

Long story short, we greatly underestimated the positive impact and community benefits of having an actual physical place. That's why we're working to correct that. To return to PIE being less virtual and more physical. Because our community needs that physical space.

#### Community, then accelerator

Attempting to start an accelerator without an existing community is a recipe, too. It’s a recipe for complete failure. For that reason, we'll cover ways to discover, identify, engage with, and collaborate with your community prior to beginning your accelerator effort.

#### Just enough
You can go too far.
* In design
* In environment
* In structure
* In goals
* In trying to over architect the experience
* In over planning and under participating

This is meant to be a little messy.

#### There is no pause button

Once you start, you cannot stop. Ever.

## How to use this cookbook

Like many cookbooks, there’s no one way to use this book. But we have designed it with two particular use cases in mind:

1. If you are intrigued by the idea of starting an accelerator but have absolutely no idea where to start—or, worse yet, are paralyzed by a fear of failure that’s preventing you from taking the leap—this book will guide you step-by-step through the iterations that PIE followed, highlighting mistakes we made along the way and culminating with the process we use to run our accelerator today.  
2. If you have already started an accelerator but are feeling like you could be doing better, this book will allow you to jump to sections that apply to specific areas of your program that you’re looking to improve. 

Like any cookbook, this book provides the recipes that worked for PIE. They may or may not work for your organization. And your special adaptations are what make the recipe work for you. 

With that in mind, it is our intention to:

- Arm you with enough knowledge to be dangerous. And to break things.
- Give you enough insight into our process for you to internalize it, change it, and create your own way of doing things.
- Encourage you to communicate back to us what worked and what didn’t. So that we can create a more compelling cookbook for everyone that is just as crazy as we are.


## Open Source

We are releasing this information as an open source project for a reason. Because we want this to be a conversation. 

This isn't a broadcast or soliloquy. It's a collaboration among communities. That's why it is equally important that your provide feedback. What was helpful? What worked? What didn't work? What was complete malarkey? Where was PIE’s experience a matter of timing and luck, rather than repeatable? How did you do things differently?

(Footnote: https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/no-interest-in-building-a-startup-accelerator-like-pie-good-f31ecbd14e05#.7ybyv2grm)


> “So with the PIE Cookbook, getting the chance to actually help lead an open source project…? That’s been a long time coming for me. I’m looking forward to learning — and probably making some mistakes. But no matter what, I’m really interested in seeing where the community takes this project.”

> - [Unnecessarily proprietary](https://medium.com/portland-incubator-experiment/unnecessarily-proprietary-a709e850d8f4#.97oi6moii)

## History

In that same vein, we are providing the PIE history as an example or parable, not a step-by-step, cookie cutter process for you to follow to achieve the same ends. 

It is important to note that, like many things in the world of startups, PIE worked at a moment in time, because of the people involved, and the way the world happened to be going in Portland, Oregon, with open source, technology, startups, blogging, and creative agencies. 

To put it another way, the way PIE came into being and worked would likely not work if we tried to do the same thing today. Too many things have changed. There is no way to recreate those random collisions of things. Or to recreate that period in time.

That said, your community is likely at a different place. Maybe there are similarities to our experience or moment in time. Maybe there are companies or individuals we’ll reference in the PIE Cookbook who remind you of someone in your community. 

Whatever the case, we are hopeful that our history with PIE provides reference points that allow you to better identify — and take advantage of — potential opportunities in your community, today.

## Recipes

We don't expect you to follow these recipes step by step. This isn't a science experiment. This is sustenance for your community. And as such, it needs to taste the way your community wants it to taste. 

We expect you to make these recipes your own. Maybe you like more salt or more spice. Do what works for your community. 

### Jump around as needed. Choose your own adventure.

And so is much of what has enabled Boulder, Colorado, to become one of the most entrepreneurially dense places on earth.

So go read it. And highlight it. And quote it.  

Don't rush it. Take the time to consume the book and think about it. Maybe a couple of times. We'll wait.

If you're working to develop and support a nascent community, Brad's book provides a critical roadmap for that development — as well as delineating a timeline for how long you should expect that development to take.

# History of PIE

## Overview

PIE began as a collaborative experiment between award-winning, global advertising firm Wieden+Kennedy and the Portland high-tech startup community. Now, PIE has evolved into an intensive three-month mentorship program designed to identify, recruit, capitalize, accelerate, and promote early stage high-tech startups which are highly efficient with investment capital, establish corporate headquarters in Oregon, create high paying jobs for Oregonians, and raise the visibility of the state on an international stage. 

The PIE model has been tested, refined, and proven over a three-year period. During that time, the program has fostered the growth of companies that have attracted more than $50 million in venture capital and created more than 150 Oregon jobs with wages averaging nearly double the baseline of the average Oregon family wage of $40,486. In addition, PIE has had the opportunity to work with corporations like Intel, Target, Coca-Cola, and Google raising the visibility of both the State of Oregon and its innovative technology community to international acclaim. 

Like the startups the program serves, PIE is extremely efficient with capital. All activity to date has been accomplished with minimal capital investment. This is thanks in part to the creative efforts of the PIE team to leverage volunteer resources, actively seek and secure in-kind contributions, and create and manage additional revenue-generating programs beyond its incubation activities.

## A melding of hypotheses

> Portland, Oregon, boasts more microbreweries, restaurants, food carts, batch distilleries, mobile startups, and open source user groups per capita than any city in the world. Some call it the most entrepreneurial city, ever. It's determined to be the most green, friendly, sustainable, bike commutable, soccer loving, and livable town you'll ever encounter. And if that's not good enough for you, it's 90 minutes from the ocean and 90 minutes from skiing and snowboarding, year round.

> But most importantly, it's the best place in the world for you to build your startup dream into a reality. To make your startup work. To make it.

> - PIE, circa 2011

So I guess you're wondering… what on earth motivated the largest privately held — and exceptionally successful — creative agency in the world to start mucking around in the world of startups? 

Well, this whole crazy experiment started quite simply. With a hypothesis. 

It's a hypothesis that **founders** — be they executives, developers, designers, or any combination there of — **are simply another form of creative**. No different than someone who paints or writes or shoots film. A creative who, instead of words and images, has chosen technology as a medium for expression. 

And like any creative, they need space to create.

And in having a space — actual physical space — you have the opportunity to put people in that space. To put those disparate groups of creatives within close proximity to one another. And in so doing, you create the opportunity for random collisions. And serendipity. From the collisions come collaborations and friction and conflict and resolution. Resulting in interesting outcomes. And demonstrating significant impact.  

But what attracted the startup community to participate in the project? Well, startups are opportunistic. Tentative but opportunistic. Quick to capitalize. But slow to trust. 

And the startup community came to the table with a hypothesis of their own. That the community had the opportunity to "Build better founders." To share knowledge and support one another. To provide a framework for mentors to engage with those who needed mentorship. To collaborate and share skill sets. 

So we took those complementary hypotheses and started testing them. Carving off a little corner in a building full of disparate creatives driven by a willingness to experiment and collaborate — and potential fail.  

Our hope was that by building better founders and enabling creatives to collide, we had the potential to artificially accelerate the startup community in Portland. And to make it easier to build a company in the city that had long been seen as a flyover town between the larger, more active startup scenes in the Bay Area and Seattle. 

## A timeline

The PIE accelerator, unbeknownst to us, started in 1995, 15 years before PIE officially became an accelerator. It started when members of the startup community started careers and built networks of peers in the dotcom days. Where classmates at our universities explored technology together. Where agencies and creative community grew in strength and numbers. Where companies had been founded and demolished. Where the open source community had created connections and collaborations. 

It took all of those things — and a growing sense of community — to start conversations. Conversations about "What if…?" What is the community had a collaborative workspace? What if there were a way for the community to have a more physical and tangible presence? What if we had a community hub that gave more gravity to what we sensed was happening?

But communicating that need to others was challenging. No one built startups in Portland, Oregon. Maybe food carts. But not tech startups. 

This wasn't even perceived as a problem. It wasn't pervasive. There weren't a ton of people who agreed with that viewpoint.

It was a non-obvious problem. And equally non-obvious was the potential opportunity.

So funding the effort was going to be a challenge. And with no active early stage investor presence — coupled with the nascent community — it would be incredibly difficult to make the argument. And it was simply too much for us to bootstrap. Even as a community.

Enter [Wieden+Kennedy](http://wk.com/).

Wieden+Kennedy — which we may also refer to as W+K or Wieden, throughout the PIE Cookbook — is the largest privately held creative agency in the world, perhaps best known for creative efforts such as Nike’s “[Just Do It](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/happy-25th-birthday-nikes-just-do-it-last-great-advertising-slogan-150947),” the [Old Spice Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE), and Chrysler’s “[Imported from Detroit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKL254Y_jtc),” among others. The worldwide headquarters of the agency are located not in New York, Chicago, or London, but in Portland’s Pearl District, where a former Fuller Brush Company warehouse holds more than 500 of their employees. The remainder of their creative talent lives around the world, gathering in offices in Amsterdam, Delhi, London, New York, Sao Paulo, Shanghai, and Tokyo.  

And in 2009 — thanks to economic doldrums and a horrible real estate market — W+K had an empty retail space sitting vacant on the first floor. 

The project didn’t even have a name at the time. It was just “the startup thing at 1227 NW Davis Street.” It would be come to known as the Portland Incubator Experiment or more commonly as “PIE,” a collaboration between members of the Portland tech startup community and Wieden+Kennedy.

I can still remember the handful of us, standing in a small circle, on the empty concrete of 3500 cavernous and columned square feet of potential.

![Sketch of the floor plan after walking through the space](/source/images/PIE-sketch-2009.jpg)

We've talked to any number of people who are overly concerned with the space. Or its appointments. We're firm believers that you work with what you've got. 

We had a former retail space that had been gutted. So it was huge columns, a concrete floor, high ceilings, and a cryptic set of light switches we never really figured out how to operate.

![PIE's nonsensical light switches](/source/images/pie-light-switches-xolotl.jpg)

It was raw. And unfinished. And difficult. 

It was perfect. 

Now, we just had to fill it with interesting people.

It was a rag tag crew. But we all had one thing in common: we were doing things. Not talking about things. Actually doing things. Not necessarily things that made money. But making things. Building things. And trying to actually get stuff done. All of us commonly driven by the frustration that Portland had a tendency to be a town where untold hours could be spent talking about what needed to happen or what opportunities existed. And then would talk about it some more. And then more. 

Without ever actually doing anything. 

And that became the primary selection criteria for the coworking space when people approached us. "What are you building?"

> **Why are we doing this**? 

> Because we don’t have all the answers. Because we believe that the people who collaborate to innovate will win. And innovation is core to the business at W+K and for our brand partners. The brand and technology mentors that have come together around PIE, the ability to scale an idea across multiple brands with massive reach and off-the-chart awareness scores, interaction with other startups and W+K involvement is something you can’t get anywhere else but here, and that’s the result of a lot of people who believe PIE represents something truly unique, both for the industry and for Portland.

> “[Filling in some more details on PIE](http://siliconflorist.com/2011/07/28/filling-details-pie/)” Silicon Florist (July 28, 2011)

It started, quite simply, as a coworking space for a handful of people from the Portland tech and startup community. Not all were tech startup founders. Some were just solitary outposts for companies like Twitter or Kickstarter. Others were building small consultancies. A handful of folks were building tech companies.

But they were all doing something. 

There were bloggers. And early stage founders. There were community builders. There were telecommuters. There were product companies. And service companies. 

But they were all doing something. Not just talking. Doing.

We worked with what we had and did very little in the way of tenant improvements. W+K decorated the space with an air of startup edginess. Closet door desks on welded sawhorses. A repurposed Starbucks sign became our coffee table. Highback leather chairs from a local second hand store became our intentionally ironic conference room. 

![PIE's iconic highback leather chairs](/source/images/pie-highback-leather-chairs.jpg) 

The first winter, the heat didn't work. So we typed away in fingerless gloves. Watching clouds of our own breath. 

We were respectful of one another, but we focused on business first. And getting shit done. 
  
Some folks would sit at their desks and take calls. Others would look for quiet corners. Or walk around the block. 

There was no privacy. So when we needed it, we took calls from the stoop. Which was only slightly colder than the interior during the winter. 

PIE began as a utilitarian space designed to do not only what the residents wanted, but what the community wanted. The space had an open floor plan. Which allowed the number of people to ebb and flow without needing to retool. It also enabled us to cram a bunch of folks in there when we needed. Or to tear down the space for speakers and events. 

We did everything from host speakers to user groups to hackathons to inviting hundreds of folks from DjangoCon to cram into the space as part of a code sprint. 

But it wasn't just businessing. We held happy hours. We served as an art gallery on "First Thursday"s. We hosted Minecraft gatherings. Basically, we tried to make the space accessible by having a policy of allowing people to stop by whenever they wanted or needed — whether they had work to do or not.

We even cleared the space out completely early in PIE's existence to create three soundstages for a 30-hour live streamed telethon put on by members of the community.  

We had watched the concept of coworking develop in the Bay Area. And took part as the concept spread to Portland and other areas. We had been participants, residents, and customers of previous spaces. But we still really didn't have any idea what might work and what would not. So we just picked price point and tried it.

At this point, W+K was providing the space gratis as part of the experiment. So any revenue generated could be used by PIE to further its objectives.

Given that we wanted the project to be communal, we decided that any revenue would go back to a general fund for PIE activities, sponsorship, and food and beverage. We would also contribute a percentage of any joint projects — some of the folks in the space could collaborate on consulting gigs — to the PIE general fund.

And we wanted rising water to float all boats. So we introduced a concept that any company started at PIE would grant 1% common stock to PIE. It was our hope that this equity would provide PIE with a means of sustaining the business over time. 

From our experience with other coworking spaces, we realized that people generally charged for desks. So we started by charging $200 per desk. That quickly eroded. But that wasn’t a bad thing. It was all part of the experiment. 

Some startups managed to squeeze multiple people around a desk. That’s just smart. And it made that $200 go a lot farther. Some were given “scholarships” to sit in PIE rent free because we believed not only in what they were building, but in the founders, themselves. And all but a few skirted the 1% equity kick in. Not because they didn't want to. But mostly because we didn’t enforce it very strongly — or even do a good job of communicating that as an expectation.

That was our fault. Not theirs. 

Wary of organizations that talked and talked and never did, PIE was designed to be a place for people who were making things. Rather than talking about them. And in that vein we wanted to accomplish something before we went public with what we were doing. 

At least in theory. 

> We thought filling the space and starting to engage with W+K account teams was something. And so we started talking about it. 

> What we wanted was something that helped Portland startups—and by that, we meant revenue generating ventures—get going as quickly as possible. Less a coworking space and more an incubator. Something that helped people get going and then booted the project out of the nest to fly on its own. Something Y Combinator like. Something like TechStars. And yet, something uniquely Portland.

{[sidebar-getting-even-more-creative.md](sidebar-getting-even-more-creative.md)}


It wasn’t well received. Which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. But it wasn't necessarily a good thing, either. There was some appropriate cynicism. And a healthy amount of questioning. With a few folks going so far as to categorize it as some carpetbagging or war profiteering move by Wieden+Kennedy. A way of the agency capitalizing on some grassroots activity in the Portland market. 

In short, the community immediately assumed that W+K was taking advantage of an opportunistic situation. 

I mean, the ire was somewhat understandable. Maybe not the unmitigated hate. But at least the ire. What the hell was this global creative agency doing dabbling in the world of startups? And why the sudden interest in Portland in particular? 

It didn’t help that, at the time, we were shallow on facts. And didn’t really have much detail to provide. Because we didn’t exactly know what we were doing. 

There simply wasn’t much there there.

We were naive in the most rudimentary sense of the term. But we continued the experiment anyway. And we went completely dark from a promotions and public relations standpoint. Until we had something more meaningful to say.

{[sidebar-fresh-pie.md](sidebar-fresh-pie.md)}

But perhaps most importantly, W+K had not been a significant part of the Portland startup community. And their sudden and intentional engagement — although seemingly ginger from the perspective of PIE participants — still ruffled feathers. 

Because W+K didn't engage the community where they were. They brought the community in. Before they were part of that community. Before the hospitality made sense. 

It was a mistake. But we worked as quickly and as diligently as we could to correct it.

We invited all kinds of random folks into the space — from interesting technology people to solo founders to early stage startups to individual contributors at companies like Automattic, Kickstarter, and Twitter. Heck, we even worked with a few early stage agencies. 

Just as important to the experiment we invited all kinds of people from Wieden+Kennedy to collaborate. 

We also invited the community to use the space. For hackathons. For events. For meetups. 

After roughly a year of observing the community, interacting with the PIE startups, observing their hardships, understanding their needs, and recognizing their opportunities, we stepped back and reassessed what we had accomplished. Or in our minds, what we had completely failed to accomplish. 

{[sidebar-pie-from-side-project-to-startup.md](sidebar-pie-from-side-project-to-startup.md)}

And so, with the blessing and backing of W+K, PIE transitioned from coworking space to accelerator, as a means of taking a more active role in the growth and development of these promising companies.

This book documents the learnings of that journey. A journey which, as of this writing, has resulted in a portfolio of more than 40 companies which have created more than 600 jobs and put more than $150 million to work in the Portland startup scene. Making PIE one of the more successful startup accelerators in the world.

By sharing the learnings from PIE, we have had the opportunity to work with a number of other accelerators around the world—corporate accelerators, innovation centers, R&D shops, for-profits, nonprofits, private, public, and everything in between—all of which have their own unique ways of managing their programs. 

We even took our learnings and cofounded a sister accelerator focused on the world of digital storytelling called Oregon Story Board. Story Board has served as a way for us to test our PIE learnings within a different target market. With a different type of creative. And to explore new ways of accelerating creative output.

Not bad for an experiment. 

Now let’s get you working on your own. And hopefully doing this whole accelerator thing way better than we have.

It's likely something that is obvious to folks who have spent a while in Portland or Austin, but it's slow to sink in to some cities. There is a value in supporting other business incubators, maker spaces, coworking spaces, in your city and build a web of trust where everyone can feel safe and supported. Competition in the classic capitalistic sense is toxic to the young businesses that need as much help and support as they can to get off the ground and should never need to feel like they are picking brands or picking sides and potentially burning bridges to get the help they need. It might seem obvious to the cookbook authors, but it's worth explaining as it's a new concept to many folks."

# Drawing inspiration from other chefs

There are a benefits to starting something after people have already tested the waters. You’re getting the chance to take advantage of learnings from predecessors to inform the organization you’re trying to build. 

We tried to do the same thing. But when we started thinking about PIE as an accelerator, we weren’t quite as lucky. Much like when we started the coworking space, there were few models from which to select—and none of them had proven whether the model would actually pencil out. (Many of them still haven’t.) 

So we just had to take our best guess from the available options. But unlike you with hundreds of successful accelerator programs from which to choose, we had, well, two. Those two models were still in their early existence but they made the most sense to us. And seemed most in line with what we were trying to accomplish. So we took a risk. And tried to glean as much as we could from what they were doing and apply those concepts to our program.

Now the names of our inspirational chefs — our Julia Child and James Beard as it were — aren’t going to be surprising to you, in this day and age. The two programs we chose to serve as role models were — now obvious thanks to their continued success — Y Combinator and TechStars. 

Things weren’t as obvious back then as they are today. There was little indication at that time that these two entities would become the juggernauts of startup acceleration that they are today. 

We just got lucky. 

Note: This is a recurring theme.

Looking back, we also made a decidedly important decision by accident. 

You see, we knew we couldn’t recreate the perceived effectiveness of either of those programs, wholesale. Because we didn’t have all of the necessary ingredients at our disposal. Nor were we in a region that would provide all of those elements. 

So rather than selecting one program after which to pattern ourselves in a cookie-cutter fashion we chose to instead dissect each program and take only the elements which we felt best resonated with our audience—and that we had a chance of effectively emulating.

That is, it did us no good to strive to set up the program up as the onramp to the Silicon Valley elite and a bevy of investors—because we didn’t have the access that would have enabled this. Instead, we took only the parts of each program we had the ingredients to effectively recreate. 

Kind of like borrowing a cup of sugar from your neighbor.
